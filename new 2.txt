• First, look for embedded Excel attachments hidden inside the PDF
 If we find an Excel file
  → extract the Excel into memory
  → search the sheet(s) for Summary of Activity and any other target fields
  → store those extracted values in the output

• If the PDF does not contain embedded Excel
 → analyze the PDF content directly using something like Camelot or text extraction
 → locate Summary of Activity inside the PDF text
 → extract that section until the stopping keyword (e.g. “ATTACH FILE”)

After each PDF is processed, you append the results to a dataset that includes:
✅ Directory path
✅ PDF file name
✅ Extracted values (Summary of Activity, etc.)

Finally, everything rolls up into a nice single Excel/CSV output.
